# faircoin-2-installation
Additional installation instruction for fairchainsx/faircoin-2

### [Installation by docker](installation_by_docker.md)

### [Installation on Ubuntu18.04](installation_on_ubuntu1804.md)

Installation procedure tested sucessfully on Ubuntu18.04 but did not work on Ubuntu16.04 because of old libraries in the packages.

This is the reason why I have assigned the installation procedure explicit to Ubuntu18.04

For other Linux systems you can try the procedure. Maybe it works maybe not. Every feedback is welcome.
